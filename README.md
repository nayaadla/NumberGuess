# NumberGuess

NumberGuess Java Program - README
Overview
NumberGuess is an interactive Java program that challenges the user to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range. This program demonstrates the use of loops, conditionals, user input, and random number generation in Java.

Features
Random Number Generation: The program generates a random number within a range (1 to 100 by default).
User Interaction: The user inputs guesses through the console.
Feedback System: Provides hints ("Too low!" or "Too high!") for each incorrect guess.
Attempts Tracker: Counts the number of attempts taken to guess the correct number.
Friendly Messages: Congratulates the user upon successfully guessing the number.
Program Flow
Random Number Generation:
The program generates a random number using the Random class.
User Input:
The user is prompted to guess the number.
Feedback:
If the guess is too low or too high, the program provides feedback and prompts another guess.
Completion:
When the correct number is guessed, the program displays a congratulatory message and the number of attempts taken.
Customization
Change the Range:
Modify the lowerBound and upperBound variables to set a different range for the random number.
Personalized Messages:
Update the System.out.println statements for customized feedback and instructions.
Learning Objectives
Understanding the Random class for generating random numbers.
Practicing user input with the Scanner class.
Implementing loops and conditionals.
Tracking attempts with a counter.
